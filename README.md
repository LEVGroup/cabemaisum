# A little outburst.
Oh, hi. I'm [lelufg](http://github.com/lelufg), the main developer of this project. First of all, I would like to say I'm deeply sorry for all those people whom believed on Cabe +1 as much as I did. It was fun, believe it or not! I **always** have fun while developing something. Maybe it's just some crazy hobby I have. *Just maybe*.

### So, what now?
Right now, LEV is thinking about something new. You know, it isn't that easy having an mindblowing idea, like Cabe +1 was. It failed because we haven't the promising investors nor ways to maintain the whole situation. To be honest, time it's our worst enemy. We expect to reach a new horizon. Some new sectors. Some new opportunities. Who knows? 

### Do you have an idea and you want to share with us?
> Well, this is some crazy idea I'm having right now. IF, ONLY IF, you have an BRILLIANT FUCKING IDEA, and you want to be HUMBLE AND NICE > enough to share with us, mailto -> cabemaisumcontato@gmail.com and we will analyze it.
